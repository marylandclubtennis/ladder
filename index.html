            This page gives an overview for the new system and should answer any questions you may have. 
            Unanswered questions or concerns should be emailed to UMD Club Tennis at

        <h2>Participation Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>
            When participating in ladder matches as a part of Maryland Club Tennis, I acknowledge that I will play with fair sportsmanship, treat my opponents and peers with respect, and uphold any values mentioned in the UMD Club Tennis Constitution© and values held by the University of Maryland.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that the initial ladder is purely based on the information the Club Tennis e-board knows and my position may not reflect the position I believe I should be in. 
            Club Tennis e-board has the right to place me anywhere on the ladder and I acknowledge that they are giving their best attempt to make the most accurate ladder standings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ladder placement plays a large role but does NOT guarantee participation in specific tournaments. Ladder practices are not an official club event or practice. I paid my dues and am signed up on IM Leagues.
        </p>
        <h2>Practice Times and Overviews</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly, note that official ladder matches do not have to be completed in these practices– they can be done whenever without any officiating from officers. Practices are there to help facilitate and encourage ladder matches. If balls are needed, Club Tennis will provide them to you.
        </p>
            Another thing to note is that these are not official practices - recwell and club sports is completely uninvolved in these practices. These "practices" is the result of the efforts from members of the 2024/2025 e-board.
        <p>
            Maryland Club Tennis will not be getting rid of the current format of official club practices to ensure non-ladder participants get the chance to experience tennis in a social learning environment. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Practices consist of singles or doubles matchplay where people are required to report scores (unless both parties agree not to).</li>
            <li>Each practice attepmt have 1 safety officer (includes e-board members and 2024 co-presidents Ani and Conrad).</li>
            <li>Balls will be provided for matches.</li>
            <li>Practice times and dates are not fixed; they will be posted on a spreadsheet.</li>
            <li>Watch the video below for more details and instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scoring Format</h2>
        <p>
            Players play an 8-game pro set, and the winner must win by 2 unless they reach 8-8 where a tiebreak will occur. The scoring format is no-ad scoring with a racket spin to determine serve.
        </p>
        <h2>Reporting Scores</h2>
        <p>
            Use the Google Form linked in the ladder page to report scores. Both players are required to fill out the form.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            Ladders are updated every Friday and take into account all scores reported in the previous week. Beating someone does not necessarily mean swapping places on the ladder.
        </p>
        <h2>Last Note</h2>
        <p>
            While the structure of these practices may sound tough, we encourage a social environment where everyone gets better. Please don’t be too hard on yourself during these matches; they do not define your value as a tennis player.
        </p>
